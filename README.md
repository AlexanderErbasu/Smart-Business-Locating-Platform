# Smart Business Locating Platform

The system is designed as a starting point for new entrepreneurs which wish to open a
new business. It uses data provided by the British Government displayed in a user-friendly
application, on easily readable and interactive maps, which aid the user in making the decision
in regard to which parameters are relevant to his/her business.

Upon careful analysis, the application aids the user in setting those aspects which are
most important for the business. Using the data provided in a fusion with the information from
the Governmental Agency, the application is able to determine the 10 Wards where the
company is most likely to succeed. There will also be provided some places which can be
rented, alongside to some websites which may be useful (such as the local government of the
Borough).
